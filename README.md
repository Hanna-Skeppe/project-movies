# Project Movies
A multi-page React-application. The app uses The Movie Database API to fetch data on movies. It displays a list of the most pupular movies right now, and when clicking on a movie a details-page about the movie displays with some more info.
The project makes use os React router and the project is a part of Technigo Bootcamp.

## Tech used
React (react router), Javascript, JSX, API:s, CSS. 

## The process
I made a main page and a details-page where I make the fetches from the API and sets up the structure with JSX. I then connected the pages in the app-component using react router, and finally I styled the content with CSS and made it responsive.
If I had more time to improve this project, I would make a few components also. I would use some more data from the API to make the site more dynamic and improve the user experience. For example I would add more content in the details page, such as links to the movies-homepage, to IMDB and to similar movies. I would also make a dropdown in the navbar so the user could toggle different movie lists.
I would also work more on the Not Found-page and error-handling.
